# RuneScape-Quest-Tracker
Track runescape quests



THIS PROGRAM WAS MADE BY LIVVYDOODLEZ


I'm releasing this under the MIT license so you can LITERALLY do what you want with it, just please keep my name in the credits is all I ask.



=======================


THIS PROGRAM USES YOUR ACCOUNT DATA!!!!


You do NOT have to login (there is no where to put a password anyway).


It does NOT connect to any account or clients.

This program simply lets you enter your username, and it looks up the data from the RuneScape's highscore table.


==========================


THERE MIGHT BE BUGS!!!


All data is dependent on the runescape wiki website. If they change the formatting of the website, it might break this program. Sorry. I tried to future proof it as much of possible.

This program does the following:

Looks up your highscores
Looks up ALL CURRENT OSRS Quests
Grabs ALL CURRENT OSRS Quest requirements and Quest Point rewards.
Stores all the data into a folder for Free Quests and Members Quests

Then compares data between your account and the quests to see if you meet requirements on the total quests.

(I tried to do it for each individual quests, but it didn't work out to well... maybe someone else can fix it.)


=============================

THIS PROGRAM IS WRITTEN IN PYTHON!

Get python here at:

YOU ARE REQUIRED TO INSTALL DEPENDENCIES!!!!

Search Bar -> Type in CMD -> Run as Administrator

(or install all at the same time by doing pip install beuatifulsoup4 requests flasks glob)

Seriously, if you don't do this, it won't work. 





===============================


HOW TO RUN!


After installing all dependencies just run START.py and it should download all necessary files for you, and start the web page.

it will open your browser at the page 127.0.0.1:8000

If it doesn't,

Just type in http://127.0.0.1:8000 into your browser. If it doesn't work, then the program didn't load. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
